# SimpleLinearRegression
Regression is one of the foundational techniques in Machine Learning. Being one of the most well-understood algorithms. In this project, we try to give you basic ideas of underlying concepts with the help of soccer players dataset. This project begins by introducing some simple real-life examples for regression. From a brief introduction to most of the concepts used in regression to hands-on experience. 

Dataset: The dataset used is the soccer player dataset. It has information about various players from different clubs, and it provides data over ten features with a number of goals as the target variable.

Tech Stack:
➔ Language: Python
➔ Libraries: pandas, statsmodel, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy
